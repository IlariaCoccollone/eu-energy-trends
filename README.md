## File Structure üìÅ

### Dashboard
- **Looker Studio Dashboard:** [View Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/p4w8uzwdh2A)  

### Project Report
- **Full Report (PDF):** [EU Energy Trends Report](eu-energy-trends-report.pdf)  

### Datasets
1. **Sustainable Energy Investment Forecast Dataset**  
   - **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zelihayb/sustainable-energy-investment-forecast-dataset/data)  
   - **Description:** Contains key indicators for sustainable energy and environmental analysis, including per capita CO‚ÇÇ emissions, energy consumption, reliance on energy sources (coal, hydro, natural gas, nuclear, oil, renewables), renewable electricity production, energy efficiency, total energy use, and demographic/spatial data (population density, total population, land area).  
   - **Scope in this project:** Only EU member countries from 2010 to 2020.

2. **Invested in Renewables ‚Äì The Only Way Forward**  
   - **Source:** [European Investment Bank](https://www.eib.org/en/essays/europe-energy-transition-renewable)  
   - **Description:** Provides two datasets:  
     1. **Investment in the energy transition ($ billion), by region:** Covers renewable energy, energy storage, power networks, electrified transport, clean shipping and industry, carbon capture, hydrogen, and nuclear energy.  
     2. **Investment in renewable energy ($ billion), by region:** Covers solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other renewable sources.  
   - **Scope in this project:** Investments from 2014 to 2023. Investments between 2010‚Äì2014 are not reported due to lack of data.
